# üå≤ Wildfire Data Dashboard

This project collects and visualizes wildfire recovery data using datasets from **Kaggle** (CSV files) and **public government wildfire APIs** (e.g., debris removal, parcel eligibility). The goal is to analyze and display real-time and historical wildfire impact and cleanup efforts across communities.

### How to Add a New Table to the Database 

1.	Create a RawData/ folder (if not already created):
	- Place any new .csv files you‚Äôd like to upload into this folder.
	- This folder is excluded in .gitignore to prevent CSVs from being committed (especially useful if the data becomes sensitive in the future).

2.	Update the table_schemas dictionary in the Python script:
    - The exact filename (must match what‚Äôs in RawData/)
    - The name of the SQL table you want to create
    - The columns you want to upload, with their PostgreSQL data types

- Example:

```
table_schemas = {
    "My_New_Data.csv": {
        "table_name": "my_new_table",
        "columns": {
            "ColumnA": "TEXT",
            "ColumnB": "INTEGER",
            "Timestamp": "DATE"
        }
    }
}
```
